~ Abstract
 In an MSc thesis conducted at Lund University, Sweden, a validation
 study of FDS version 6.2.0 on the area of external fire spread was
 conducted. The validation study was performed using experimental data
 from a large-scale fire test on a SP FIRE 105 test rig in Borås, Sweden.
 The SP FIRE 105 test rig is a test method for facade systems simulating
 the impact on the overhead facade of a fire on ground floor of a
 three-storey apartment building. For this particular test,
 non-combustible calcium silica boards were attached to the facade and
 temperature measurements took place at six different heights. A previous
 validation study for this setup has been conducted by SP using FDS
 version 5.5.3, showing promising results. However, as FDS is updated it
 does not automatically mean that every area is improved, and possible
 changes are important to address. Also, in the revision of the model
 from version 5 to version 6 changes were made in the basic turbulence
 model, meaning that a different result than the SP study was to be
 expected. The study concluded that FDS version 6.2.0 could reproduce the
 experimental results with a reasonable level of detail. Moreover, the
 studied output data produced in FDS 6.2.0 were generally higher than its
 precursor. However, to obtain credible results along the facade
 particularly close to the fire, a high mesh resolution was needed,
 namely a $D^{*}/\delta x$ of at least 30.

# INTRODUCTION { #sec-intro }
Today FDS calculations are often used to model fires in complex building
designs. However, there are large risks in using FDS if there is a lack
of user knowledge, since FDS is highly dependent on the input variables
that are specified. Also, there is a risk in relying on results from
previous validation studies of FDS performed on completely different
geometries or setups than the intended or in situations where FDS is not
yet valid. In addition to this, changes in the model might affect the
results and can render previous validation studies invalid.

The background to this work lies in the results of an MSc
thesis [@NilssonM] conducted at Lund University, Sweden, investigating
the impact of horizontal projections on external fire spread using the
numerical tool FDS 6.2.0 [@FDSUser]. As part of the thesis and to avoid
the above-mentioned risks, a validation study was performed on FDS as
calculation tool or modelling external fire spread. In the validation
study, experimental data from a large-scale fire test [@Evegren] on a SP
FIRE 105 test rig [@SpFire105] in Borås, Sweden were used. This
particular setup were chosen since the geometry is closely linked to the
setup used in the following part of the thesis as well since previous
numerical work on this particular test has been carried out on FDS
5.5.3 [@Anderson:1; @Anderson:2].

The previous validation study showed promising result, but as FDS
progresses and new versions are released, updated validation studies are
necessary. It is crucial to frequently validate and highlight changes
done in the FDS code. Relying on old, or in worst case none, validation
studies could result in irreparable damages. Hence validation of changes
made in FDS is essential, especially in areas where previous validation
studies are scarce as in the case of external fire spread.

Two major changes in FDS 6.2.0 compared to FDS 5.5.3 is that the former
version use constant Smagorinsky model to model turbulence viscosity
while the latter use Deardorff’s model as well as a new scalar transport
scheme are implemented in FDS 6.2.0. A major downside with the constant
Smagorinsky model in FDS 5.5.3 is that it is too dissipative, meaning a
fine grid size is needed in order to attain accurate results. The
Deardorff model on the other hand are said to perform at both coarse and
fine grid resolutions [@FDSGoogle]. The changes in the turbulence
viscosity model and the scalar transport scheme is closely linked to the
dynamics of the fire, which of course are important even when studying
external fire spread, and therefore an embryo to a new validation study
was born.

# METHODOLOGY
In this paper the aim is to describe the validation study done in the MSc
thesis mentioned above [@NilssonM] and its results. The approach of the
validation study was first to determine and extract essential
experimental data from the selected large-scale fire test on the SP FIRE
105 test rig in Borås, Sweden. The large-scale fire test was thereafter
simulated in FDS 6.2.0 in order to validate the new version of the
CFD-software against the setup.

Several simulations was performed in FDS including sensitivity analysis
covering the influence of different grid sizes, different mesh
alignments, alternate positions of thermocouple devices, the choice of
radiation angles, Heat Release Rate Per Unit Area (HRRPUA) as well as the
choice of soot yield. The results obtained were then compared to those
from the experimental test rig. Further, the key results were compared
against the results from the previous validation study on FDS
5.5.3 [@Anderson:1].

# EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
## SP FIRE 105 test rig
The SP FIRE 105 test is a large-scale test method for analyzing reaction
to fire properties of facade systems. The method specifies a procedure to
determine reaction to fire properties of different assemblies of
materials, insulation, and claddings when exposed to fire from a
simulated apartment fire where flames emerge through a large window
opening, i.e. the fire spread on combustible external walls.

The SP FIRE 105 test was developed in Sweden in 1985 [@SpFire105], based
on a broad experimental study of external fire spread [@Ondrus]. In the
eighties new building materials was introduced and hence more intense
fires was anticipated, and a recognized test method for external fire
spread was therefore needed. External fire spread on combustible walls
has been studied for decades and the SP FIRE 105 test is one among other
test methods that has been proposed throughout the years [@Hildebrand].
The initial Swedish test method was introduced in 1958 [@Johannesson] and
the amended SP FIRE 105 test is nowadays a standardized test in Sweden,
Denmark, and Norway.

The test rig consists of a 150 mm thick lightweight concrete wall, 4 000
mm (W) by 6 000 mm (H), above a fire compartment with a 3 000 mm (W) by
710 mm (H) front opening. For air intake the compartment has a horizontal
opening in the floor, close to its back wall, measuring 3 140 mm (W) by
300 mm (D). The fire source consists of two trays each filled with 30
liters of heptane positioned next to each other, each measuring 1 000 mm
(W) by 100 mm (H) by 500 mm (D). Above the tray edges a flame suppressing
lattice is installed. Further, after each tray has been filled with 30
liters of heptane, water is added such that the fuel level is touching
the underside of the lattice. The upper drawing of
Figure [#figure1], [@Evegren], illustrates the setup.

The mentioned test rig setup was slightly altered in the tests used as
reference in the validation study of FDS 6.2.0. The reason for the
alternation was to evaluate fire growth on external combustible ship
surfaces with FRP instead of a regular building facade system [@Evegren].
In the alternated setup non-combustible calcium silica boards
(Promatect®) with 10 mm thickness of the test specimen was fastened along
the facade, covering the two fictitious windows as illustrated in the
drawing in Figure [#figure1]. The total dimensions of the boards were 3
750 mm (W) by 6 000 mm (H). This test was referred to as the reference
test and retrieved data from this test laid the foundation for the
validation study. In the lower pictures of Figure [#figure1] the fire
development during the reference test is seen.

## Arrangement, instrumentation and measurements in the reference test
The thermal exposure was estimated at the panel surface with six Inconel
steel plates with wire thermocouples spot-welded on their backside,
fastened flush with the surface. The steel plates were nominally 0.7 mm
thick, measured 150 mm by 150 mm and covered a hole (Ø100 mm) drilled
through the panels for the thermocouple wires. Further, six sheathed type
K thermocouples (Ø0.50 mm) were placed along the centerline of the panels
in order to quantify the gas temperature in the buoyancy plume along the
centerline of the panels. The thermocouples were placed 50 mm from the
front surface of the panels and, as seen in Figure [#figure1], positioned
50 mm offset the plate thermometers. In conclusion, the measurements took
place at 0.5 m (C21/C27), 1.6 m (C22/C28), 2.7 m (C23/C29), 3.8 m
(C24/C30), 4.8 m (C25/C31) and 5.9 m (C26/C32) above the opening.
Moreover, gas temperature, velocity and generation of gaseous species
such as CO, CO2 and depletion of O2 was measured during the test by a
large Industrial Calorimeter, meaning both the convective and the total
heat release rate could be estimated during the test [@Evegren].
Information about the HRR history of the reference test is found in
Figure [#figure3], [@Evegren; @NilssonM].

## Incident radiation using a plate thermometer
The incident radiation was studied using the retrieved temperatures from
the thermometers and the thermocouples. The incident radiation
$\dot{q}^{\prime\prime}_{inc}$ $(W/m^{2})$ was then derived from the
following equation, Equation [#equation1], [@Evegren]:

~ Equation  {#Equation1; caption:"Equation1" }
  \dot{q}^{\prime\prime}_{inc} = \sigma T_{s}^{4} - \dfrac{h_{c}(T_{g}-T_{s})}{\epsilon} + \dfrac{dc\rho}{\epsilon} \cdot \dfrac{dT}{dt}
~

where $\sigma$ $(5.67 \times 10^{-8} W/(m^{2} \cdot K^{4}))$ is the
Stefan Boltzmann constant, $d$ $(0.7 mm)$ is the plate thickness , $c$
$(7 850 J/(kg \cdot K))$ is the specific heat of steel, $\rho$
$(480 kg/m^{3})$ is the density of the steel plate and $\epsilon$ is the
emissivity assumed to be of 0.9 (-) [@Evegren]. The variable $T_{s}$ is
defined as the surface temperature of the plate thermometer and $T_{g}$
is defined as the temperature of the free air flow (gas temperature).
From the following equation, Equation  [#equation2], [@Evegren], the
forced convective heat transfer $h_{c}$ $(W/(m^{2} \cdot K)$ was
estimated:

~ Equation  {#Equation2; caption:"Equation2" }
  h_{c} = 2.4 T_{f}^{0.085} \cdot u_{\infty}^{1/2} \cdot x^{-1/2}
~

where $u$ is the velocity of the vertical air flow and $x$ is a
characteristic length. Based on video recordings from the experiment the
air velocity was estimated to 6 m/s and the characteristic length was set
to 0.2 m (the side measurement of the square plate). The film temperature
$T_{f}$ is the average of the $T_{s}$ and $T_{g}$ [@Evegren]. The forced
convective heat transfer coefficient $h_{c}$ varied between 22 and 24
during the test using Equation [#equation2], [@Evegren].

Note that Equation [#equation1] is based on the following simplified heat balance equation, Equation 289 in [@Wickstrom1], in this paper entitled Equation [#equation3]:

~ Equation  {#Equation3; caption:"Equation3" }
  \epsilon_{PT} \dot{q}^{\prime\prime}_{inc} - \epsilon_{PT} \sigma T_{PT}^{4} + h_{PT} (T_{g} - T_{PT}) + K(T_{g} - T_{PT})=C \dfrac{dT_{PT}}{dT}
~

where the suffix $PT$ refers to Plate Thermometer. The equation describes
the heat balance on the exposed plate surface of a plate thermometer.
From Equation [#equation3] the term $\dot{q}^{\prime\prime}_{inc}$ is
extracted from the heat balance equation and conduction is neglected,
forming Equation [#equation1]. However, in Equation [#equation1], the
convective term is subtracted, which means in other words that the
expression $\dot{q}^{\prime\prime}_{inc}$ is the incident radiative part
of the total heat transfer. Hence, the latter term is referred to as
incident radiative heat flux, $\dot{q}^{\prime\prime}_{IRHF}$ $(W/m^{2})$
in this paper.

The plate thermometer measures approximately the temperature of a surface
which cannot absorb any heat, also called the
$\textit{adiabatic surface temperature}$ $(T_{AST})$. The $T_{AST}$ is an
illustrative temperature measure both taking into account the influence
from incident radiation and the convective heating from the surrounding
gas [@Wickstrom2]. For example, if an exposed body is far away from the
fire source, radiation is the dominating part and hence the $T_{AST}$
will be closer to an effective radiation temperature $T_{r}$. If,
however, the body is exposed by mainly convection from the hot gases,
$T_{AST}$ will be closer to the gas temperature $T_{g}$. Since this
measure is implemented in FDS, it can then be used as an alternative
means of expressing the thermal exposure to a surface without taking into
account the energy gain or loss through conduction from the exposed body.

# ARRANGEMENT IN FDS
The model in FDS was built up using building materials corresponding to
the test rig as far as possible. The geometry of the reference test in
FDS can be seen in Figure [#figure2], [@NilssonM].

[Figure2]: images/Figure2.jpg "Figure2" { width:auto; max-width:100% }

The different grid sizes used in FDS are presented in
Table [#table1], [@NilssonM]. The main model was built up by a single
mesh in order to avoid high speed flow at mesh alignments, which in turn
can affect the results of the simulation. A sensitivity analysis was
later conducted covering the potential influence on results of different
mesh alignments, presented in the sensitivity analysis chapter.

The ratio $D^{*}/\delta x$ for the conducted simulations are
approximately 8, 15 and 30 for the coarse, medium and fine grid
respectively. These values can be compared with the values
($D^{*}/\delta x$ of 4-16) that historically has been used as reference
in FDS applications. The values of 8, 15 and 30 can also be put in
relation to the values represented in Table 3.11 in the FDS validation
guide [@FDSValidation], where the mean value of the lower range limits is
of around 8 and the mean value of the upper range is of around 16.

The finest grid size used in the validation study corresponds to a higher
value than 16, which means it is considered to give better results from
the accuracy perspective but on the negative side enhance the simulation
time drastically. For the current single mesh simulations, computational
times of 1.5, 18 and 232 h were exhibited for the 20, 10 and 5 cm cells.
Even though the simulation with 5 cm grid size gave simulation times that
were multiple times as long as for the 10 cm and 20 cm case, it was
considered important to study a grid size this small as it is known that
the choice of grid size gives the single most influence on the solution
in FDS [@Rubini].

##Design fire
Because of the use of a flame suppressing lattice in the reference test,
the design fire in FDS could not be based on a simple heptane pool fire.
This is because the HRR in the latter case would be significantly higher
without the flame suppressing lattice. Therefore the HRR used in the
simulations were modeled using the HRR measurements from the reference
test. The Ramp functions in FDS in combination with a surface with a
specified HRRPUA gave the final HRR-curve. In Figure [#figure3] both the
actual HRR history during the large-scale fire test and the HRR used in
one of the FDS setups are seen.

As seen in the left picture in Figure [#figure3], [@Evegren; @NilssonM],
the HRR peaked at 1 800 kW after around 400 s then declined to around 1
500 kW the following minutes. After 600 s the fire developed rapidly
creating a second peak at approximately 3 100 kW, which lasted for about
120 s before it gradually declined as the level of heptane in the trays
decreased.

The fire properties in FDS were set to match the chemical properties of
heptane. The soot yield of heptane was set to 0.037, which was collected
from a validation study of smoke and toxic gas concentrations in a test
compartment [@Rinne]. The radiative fraction was the default value of
0.35 for FDS 6.2.0, which can be compared with the value of 0.33 for
well-ventilated heptane fires as found in [@SFPE].

## Measurement devices
The devices used in the FDS simulations along with their positions are
seen in Figure [#figure4], [@NilssonM]. The default thermocouples in FDS
were used as a basis, which is a nickel-based thermocouple with specific
heat of 0.44 $(kJ/kg \cdot K)$, density of 8908 $(kg/m^{3})$ and
emissivity of 0.85. However, to match the sheathed type K thermocouples
in the actual fire test (C27-C32), the bead diameter was changed from 1
mm to 0.5 mm. In addition to these six thermocouples, additional ten
thermocouples were placed every 10 cm offset the symmetry line along the
facade, as seen at position 4 in Figure [#figure4]. Further, six velocity
devices were positioned just outside the facade at each height as seen at
position 5.

To be able to simulate the plate thermometers in FDS, six obstacles were
defined and placed along the symmetry line of the facade (C21-C26). Two
surfaces were created built up by 0.7 mm thin layer of metal together
with a 1 cm thick layer of insulation, which then were applied on the
obstacles depending on the direction of heat transfer. Wall temperature
devices were then placed at the backside of these plates to measure the
surface temperature.

In addition, measurements of adiabatic surface temperature ($T_{AST}$),
incident heat flux ($\dot{q}^{\prime\prime}_{inc}$) and convective heat
flux ($\dot{q}^{\prime\prime}_{c}$) took place at the same positions
as for the wall temperature devices. The former was done in order to
compare the retrieved temperatures from the plate thermometers during the
reference test with the illustrative temperature $T_{AST}$ in FDS. The
measurements of incident heat flux and convective heat flux took place in
order to produce comparable incident heat flux results to the reference
test. The procedure for doing this is described further down.

~ Figure { #Figure4; caption:"Picture illustrating the device positions in FDS. Left - The front of the test rig along with the six plate thermometers. Middle - Close-up of each thermometer position and other devices used. Right - Same as the middle picture but in 3D."}

##Extracting incident radiative heat flux results in FDS
Since there are no device that directly produce the same form of heat
flux in FDS as computed from the reference test described above
($\dot{q}^{\prime\prime}_{IRHF}$), the information given in [@Overholt]
was used. In FDS, the quantity incident heat flux
$\dot{q}^{\prime\prime}_{inc} (W/m^{2})$ is the sum of the incoming
radiation and convection, not including the outgoing
radiation [@Overholt]. The quantity incident heat flux is described in
the following equation, Equation [#equation4], [@FDSUser]:

~ Equation  {#Equation4; caption:"Equation4" }
  \dot{q}^{\prime\prime}_{inc} = \dfrac{\dot{q}^{\prime\prime}_{rad}}{\epsilon} + \sigma T_{w}^{4} + \dot{q}^{\prime\prime}_{c}
~

Further, there is also a quantity called radiative heat flux, described
as the sum of the incoming and reflecting radiation as seen in the
following equation, Equation [#equation5], [@Overholt]:

~ Equation  {#Equation5; caption:"Equation5" }
  \dot{q}^{\prime\prime}_{rad} = \dot{q}^{\prime\prime}_{rad, in} - \dot{q}^{\prime\prime}_{rad, out} = \dot{q}^{\prime\prime}_{rad, in} - \epsilon \sigma T_{w}^{4}
~

Substituting Equation [#equation5] in Equation [#equation4] results in
the following equation, Equation [#equation6]:

~ Equation  {#Equation6; caption:"Equation6" }
  \dot{q}^{\prime\prime}_{inc} = \dfrac{\dot{q}^{\prime\prime}_{rad, in}}{\epsilon} + \dot{q}^{\prime\prime}_{c}
~

At this stage, to be able to compare the quantity
$\dot{q}^{\prime\prime}_{inc}$ in FDS with the computed
$\dot{q}^{\prime\prime}_{IRHF}$-values from the reference test, the
convective term was subtracted from Equation [#equation6]. This means
that the $\dot{q}^{\prime\prime}_{IRHF}$-output data in FDS were produced
by subtracting the $\dot{q}^{\prime\prime}_{inc}$-values with the
$\dot{q}^{\prime\prime}_{c}$-values from FDS, resulting in the
following equation, Equation [#equation7]:

~ Equation  {#Equation7; caption:"Equation7" }
  \dot{q}^{\prime\prime}_{IRHF} = \dot{q}^{\prime\prime}_{inc} - \dot{q}^{\prime\prime}_{c} = \dfrac{\dot{q}^{\prime\prime}_{rad, in}}{\epsilon} 
~

Again, this was done since in FDS there are no device that directly
produce the same form of heat flux computed in the given large-scale fire
test.

#RESULTS
In this section the key results from the main simulations performed on a
single mesh and 5 cm grid are presented. Data values named EXP are values
retrieved from the reference test and the data values named FDS are those
retrieved from the FDS-simulations. In the following sensitivity
analysis, results from the simulations performed on the 10 cm and 20 cm
grid size are shown. For all results the reader is referred
to [@NilssonM].

## Temperature
A comparison of temperature data retrieved from the thermocouples in the
reference test and FDS are presented in Figure [#figure5], [@NilssonM].
As seen in Figure [#figure5], a good correspondence is found close to the
fire source but FDS slightly overestimates the temperatures further up,
particularly at position C29 and C30. This behaviour is fairly consistent
during both peaks in the HRR history.

~ Figure { #Figure5; caption:"FDS 5 cm cells, comparison of temperatures from the thermocouples during the reference test and those calculated in FDS. Left - The three positions closest to the opening. Right - The three positions further up along the facade. As indicated by the vertical lines, two of the thermocouples (C27 and C28) failed during the test."}

A comparison of the temperature data retrieved from the plate
thermometers in the reference test and the simulated thermometers in FDS
are presented in Figure [#figure6], [@NilssonM]. A good agreement is seen
at position C23-C26 except for a slight underestimation at position C25
and C26 as well as for a slight overestimation at position C23 and C24.
An underestimation of some 100 °C is seen at position C22 closer to the
fire. However, closest to the fire at position C21 the modelled plate
thermometer has problems to reproduce the transient temperatures in the
early stage of the fire and in the second peak it underestimates the
temperature with some 100 °C.

## Adiabatic surface temperature
A comparison of $T_{AST}$ in FDS and the retrieved temperatures from the
plate thermometers during the reference test are shown in
Figure [#figure7], [@NilssonM]. Unlike the already discussed modelled
thermometers in Figure [#figure1], the $T_{AST}$-values are slightly
overestimating the temperatures retrieved from the thermometers at
position C22-C26. At position C21, the transient representation in the
early stage of the temperature rise is better represented and just
underestimating the retrieved temperatures at the second peak.

## Incident radiation
The computed $\dot{q}^{\prime\prime}_{IRHF}$-values at the facade during
the reference test and the corresponding measurements in FDS are shown in
Figure [#figure8], [@NilssonM]. A good agreement is found between the
measurements at position 2 and 5. At position 3 and 4 however the
$\dot{q}^{\prime\prime}_{IRHF}$-values are twice the actual in FDS. A
similar behaviour is seen at position 6. At position 1 closest to the
fire, FDS is having trouble to match the computed heat flux in the
transient approach. However, later on at the second peak of the HRR story
the calculated $\dot{q}^{\prime\prime}_{IRHF}$-values in FDS
underestimates the computed $\dot{q}^{\prime\prime}_{IRHF}$-values with
some 15 %.

# SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
The key results from the sensitivity study are presented in this section,
for complementary results the reader is referred to [@NilssonM]. Either
the results are presented directly in the text or references are made to
the results in [@NilssonM].

## Grid sensitivity
The grid sizes of 20 cm, 10 cm and 5 cm in the simulations result in mesh
resolutions of around 8, 15 and 30 at maximum HRR 3.1 MW. These values
can be put in relation to the values represented in Table 3.11 of the FDS
validation guide [@FDSValidation], where the mean value of the lower
range limits is of around 8 and the mean value of the upper range is of
around 16. A fine grid resolution results in higher computational cost,
which also has to be considered when setting up FDS-simulations. For the
current single mesh simulations, computational times of 1.5, 18 and 232 h
were exhibited for the 20, 10 and 5 cm cells.

As seen in Figure [#figure9]-[#figure11], [@NilssonM], the overall
difference between the coarse grid size and the other grid sizes is
considerable. The coarse 20 cm grid size consequently underestimates the
actual temperatures close to the fire and higher up along the facade. The
10 cm grid performs well at positions further up along the facade in
general, however close to the fire source large discrepancies are found.
The fine grid size of 5 cm performs generally well close to the fire
source but overestimates the temperatures further up, especially for the
temperatures retrieved from the thermocouples and the $T_{AST}$.

The overall difference between the coarse grid size and the other grid
sizes are also large in regards to $\dot{q}^{\prime\prime}_{IRHF}$ as
seen in Figure [#figure12], [@NilssonM]. The 20 cm grid consequently
underestimates the radiation outputs on all positions. The 10 cm grid
show promising results higher up but demonstrates only a small increase
in heat flux close to the fire source at position 1 compared with the 20
cm grid. For the 5 cm grid, $\dot{q}^{\prime\prime}_{IRHF}$-values twice
the computed ones are shown at position 3 and 4. The 5 cm grid performs
well higher up and the calculated $\dot{q}^{\prime\prime}_{IRHF}$ in FDS
underestimate the computed $\dot{q}^{\prime\prime}_{IRHF}$ with some 15
%. However, the biggest problem is still the agreement during the
transient phase for position 1.

## Influence of mesh alignments
The effect of dividing the computational domain into differently aligned
meshes was studied [@NilssonM]. This was conducted mainly on the 5 cm
grid however one simulation was divided into two meshes with different
grid sizes (10 cm cells in the fire room and 5 cm cells outside). The
different mesh intersections of the computational domain that were
studied are shown as purple lines in Figure [#figure13], [@NilssonM].

Minor discrepancies were found for the 3 meshes and 2
meshes-configurations compared with the single mesh simulation in regards
to temperature and radiation outputs. The 3 meshes configuration results
in slightly higher values of all output data compared with the single
mesh simulation. Larger discrepancies were found for the 2 meshes 5 cm
and 10 cm configuration with considerable lower output data in general,
especially in regards to incident radiation. An important finding from
this part was the computational time that could be saved when dividing
the domain into several meshes, still resulting in comparable result to
the single mesh simulation. Note that this was even if the mesh
intersections were horizontally. However, this was based on the
precondition that a uniform fine grid size (5 cm) was used in the
simulation on all meshes. Using a coarser grid size inside (10 cm) the
fire compartment and a fine grid size outside was seen to underestimate
the output, as described above.

## Influence of the choice of thermocouple position
As seen in Figure [#figure4], thermocouples were placed every 10 cm
offset the symmetry line. By doing this, the sensitivity in the choice of
a device position was studied for a facade test rig. This was done in
both the 5 cm grid and 10 cm grid for the single mesh simulations. From
the results [@NilssonM] it was seen that the thermocouple generating the
highest temperatures was generally the thermocouple with the preferred
position as per the drawing in Figure [#figure1]. However, in the 10 cm
grid simulation close to the fire this thermocouple represents the lowest
temperature. As a general rule for both grid sizes, large differences in
temperatures between the far most left and the far most right device are
seen along the surface of the facade, at some positions almost 400 °C.
However, the further up temperature the measurements were retrieved, the
more the temperature differences between the far most left device and far
most right were evened out.

## Influence of increased radiation angles and increased HRRPUA
The standard number of radiation angles in FDS is 100, which is
considered reasonable in most situations bearing in mind the 20 % of the
CPU time of a calculation that is required for this setting [@FDSUser].
However, given the geometry and properties of fire scenarios in some
cases, the default value of 100 can be insufficient. The default value of
100 angles was changed to 500 angles to study potential differences in
the results [@NilssonM]. However, the increase in radiation angles
resulted in minor differences in temperature and radiation outputs. Note
that the change in radiation angles resulted in an increase of 73 h in
computational time or some 30 %.

Also, the effect of an increase in HRRPUA was studied by doubling the
HRRPUA [@NilssonM]. Instead of specifying 3100 $kW/m^{2}$ on a 1 $m^{2}$
burner, 6200 $kW/m^{2}$ was used on a 0.5 $m^{2}$ burner (2 000 mm (W) by
250 mm (D)). Note that the modelled HRR remained unchanged and the tray
still was modelled at the same width to prevent any potential differences
in the output concerning the flame spread along the facade. However, the
increase from 3100 $kW/m^{2}$ to 6200 $kW/m^{2}$ gave minor changes in
temperature and radiation outputs.

## Influence of increased soot yield
In the main simulations a soot yield of 0.037 was specified based on the
results of a validation study of smoke and toxic gas concentrations in a
test compartment [@Rinne]. The soot yield was increased to 0.1 to observe
any differences in the output data. Regarding gas temperatures, the
change in soot yield had minor effects. However, temperatures from the
modelled plate temperatures were seen to increase especially on the
positions closest to the fire nearly reaching the actual temperature
during the second peak of the HRR history. The increase in soot yield
also increased the $\dot{q}^{\prime\prime}_{IRHF}$-output with some 20 %
at position 1 closest to the fire source, now reaching the same level as
the measured incident radiation during the test.

# A COMPARISON WITH FDS VERSION 5.5.3
In Figure [#figure14], comparisons are made to the results from the
previous validation study on FDS 5.5.3 for the same test [@NilssonM;
@Anderson:1]. Note that the output data from FDS are slightly offset each
other, which is due to different start times of the HRR history. In
general, FDS 6.2.0 are producing higher values than FDS 5.5.3 for the
given configuration, especially regarding the modelled plate thermometer
temperatures and on positions close to the opening. The similar is seen
for incident radiation. Regarding temperatures retrieved from the
thermocouples, only small discrepancies are found between the program
versions at position C27 and C28 with slightly higher values in FDS
6.2.0. At position C29 however, considerable higher values are
represented in FDS 6.2.0.

# DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
As mentioned above, there is a risk in relying on results from previous
validation studies of FDS performed in a different geometry, setup or
version than the intended or in situations where FDS is not yet valid,
since uncertainties are being introduced into the calculations. Also, as
FDS is updated to improve the predictions of fire scenarios in some areas
it does not automatically mean that every area is improved. The
validation study of FDS 6.2.0 on the modified SP FIRE 105 test rig was
conducted to avoid the above-mentioned risks. Further, it was considered
important to first evaluate the intended calculation tool for modelling
external fire spread before using it in the following comparative
analysis in the thesis. In addition, the scenario had previously only
been validated against FDS 5.5.3 and possible changes between the program
versions are important to address.

The comparison of output data between FDS 6.2.0 and FDS 5.5.3 showed that
FDS 6.2.0 generally produce higher temperatures and incident radiative
heat fluxes for the given setup. The study also shows that FDS 6.2.0
produce results that are more in line with the output data from the test
compared to FDS version 5.5.3. The greatest difference in results was
seen for the modelled thermometers and especially at position C21 closest
to the fire. One of the biggest changes between the program versions is
the implementation of a new model for turbulent viscosity. In FDS 5.5.3
the Smagorinsky model is used to model turbulence while FDS 6.2.0 use
Deardorff’s model. The models determine the behaviour of the velocity
field and hence to a large extent the dynamics of the fire [@FDSGoogle].

The results from a similar validation study from Stord/Haugesund
University College in Norway [@Gamlemshaug] highlight a difference
between FDS 5 and FDS 6, involving the change of the turbulent viscosity
model. In the latter study the main goal was to look at the thermal
impact on external vertical steel structures from an ejecting fire plume.
The fire room in the chosen large-scale fire test had the dimensions 4.0
m (W) by 2.2 m (D) by 2.6 m (H). The fire plume was ejecting out from a 3
m wide and 1.2 m high opening positioned 20 cm under the ceiling. It
turned out that FDS 5.5.3 was not able to simulate the gas velocities
through the window correctly and the fire plume was seen to eject further
away from the room compared to the fire plume in the actual test. After
activating the beta version of FDS 6, the fire plume was seen to eject
closer to the facade corresponding better to the measurements in the
actual test. The use of Deardorff’s turbulent viscosity model and the
change in calculation method for time steps given by the velocity vectors
in the beta-version of FDS6 were stated as some of the likely reasons to
the changes in the results. Given this, the higher temperatures from FDS
6.2.0 in Figure [#figure14] may be due to the change of model for
turbulent viscosity, which affects the velocity fields through the
opening and hence the appearance and impact of the ejecting plume in FDS.

The incident radiative heat fluxes from the reference test presented in
this paper are calculated values based on measured temperatures from the
plate thermometers from the actual test. These temperatures can be
observed in e.g. Figure [#figure6]. As seen in Figure [#figure1],
generally there is a trend with drastically increasing temperatures after
600 s at the start of the second peak. At position C21 closest to the
fire however, this trend is not as prominent, and the temperature curve
is seen to increase steadily during the whole fire scenario differently
compared with the other positions. The similar appearance is seen in
Figure [#figure8] at the same position regarding incident radiation. In
this case after 600 s there is a gap between the measured heat flux and
the computed heat flux of more than 50 $kW/m^{2}$, which is not seen at
the remaining positions. At the same time these tendencies are not seen
for the temperature retrieved from the thermocouple at the same position
in Figure [#figure5].

An uncertainty analysis was performed due to the above
observations [@NilssonM]. The uncertainty analysis showed that the
uncertainty in the computation of $\dot{q}^{\prime\prime}_{IRHF}$ in the
reference test from Eq. 1 lies in the temperature measurements retrieved
from the steel plate thermometers. In the video footages it can be seen
that the lower part of the facade is hardly damaged after the test and
the Promatect cladding is hanging loose [@Evegren], signalling on a high
stress during the test. The latter caused two of the thermocouples close
to the opening to fail later during the test as described in
Figure [#figure5]. Also, gaps between the Promatect cladding and the
thermometer were visible. This may have caused changes around the flow
field that affected the measurement in the test, which then affects the
calculation of the incident radiative heat fluxes.

Other possible reasons for this temperature rise tendency could be the
way the HRR is measured. A possible explanation for the rapid development
between the two phases in the HRR history could be that the heptane
starts to boil as the heat in the fire room reaches a significant
level [@Evegren]. The reason for the rapid increase in HRR rate could
then be this combined effect causing an intense pyrolysis and combustion
of heptane. However, since the HRR is based on measurements using a large
Industrial Calorimeter and not on actual mass loss measurements in the
fire room, there is a risk that some of the details in the rapid phase of
the HRR story were lost, because it takes time for the hot gases to
travel from the burn room up to the hood before it can be analysed.
Another source of error could be that the suction flow rate of the
Calorimeter has been changed during the test, which would affect the
calculation of HRR over time from which the FDS is ramped by.

The above-mentioned could be the explanation to why the modelled plate
thermometer temperature in FDS is seen to underestimate the temperature
retrieved from the plate thermometer at position C21 for the 5 cm grid
and single mesh simulation; although otherwise the temperatures are well
resolved by FDS along the facade. Comparing the modelled plate
thermometer temperatures in FDS with the $T_{AST}$ in FDS, it is seen
that the modeled plate thermometer temperatures are lower than the
$T_{AST}$. However, temperatures that are retrieved from plate
thermometers cannot fully be equated with $T_{AST}$. The thermal inertia
of the plate thermometer and heat loss through the insulation material
behind are factors that explains why retrieved temperatures from the
thermometers are lower than the $T_{AST}$ during the heating process.
Thus, it is reasonable that $T_{AST}$-values from FDS in
Figure [#figure7] are not just higher than the modeled plate thermometer
temperatures in FDS in Figure [#figure6], but also higher than the
retrieved temperatures from the thermometer in the actual test. Another
factor that separates these measurements is the response time of the
plate thermometer, which is necessary to include in transient scenarios
if a direct comparison to the thermometers is desired [@Jansson]. Since
the $T_{AST}$-values from FDS in Figure [#figure7] are based on direct
calculations the response time are not included, which would be the
reason for the generally much higher values during the heating phase
compared to the cooling phase, most evident in the first 300 s at
position C21.

A conclusion based on the results in this paper is the importance of a
high mesh resolution in order to obtain credible result in these kinds of
calculations. However, the refinement in grid size causes problems
regarding the computational time needed for the simulation, which was
seen to rise significantly from 18 to 232 h in the performed simulations
in the validation study. Even if the computational domain is divided into
several meshes, that was shown to not greatly affect the results in the
sensitivity analysis, the difference in computational time between a
$D^{*}/\delta x$ ratio of 15 and 30 is still substantial.

One reason for the difference in output between the fine grid size and
the coarser grid sizes is probably the finer grid´s ability to resolve
more of the turbulence of the fire plume. The smaller the grid, the more
of the large eddies are resolved in FDS contributing to a plume with
better air entrainment. Because a finer grid captures more of the motion
in a fire the difference in results will be more prominent close to the
fire source, since the turbulence is more dominant in this region.
Especially for this geometry a finer grid will resolve more of the
turbulence around the opening, which may create a more realistic plume
ejecting out from the fire room. Considering
this it is likely to assume that the plume in a finer grid will adapt more 
and appear more realistic.     

Apart from the grid sensitivity study, another input variable that was
shown to be important in the sensitivity analysis was the soot yield
parameter. The increase in soot yield from 0.037 to 0.1 had a great
effect on the radiation outputs especially close to the opening. A
possible reason for this increase could be that in the reference test the
amount of soot produced by the fire varied with the HRR story. The higher
the heat release became the more soot was produced since the burning rate
was increased. Also, a fire that is on the verge of becoming an
under-ventilated fire produces more soot. This would be the case for the
SP FIRE 105 test rig since it simulates external fire spread from a
burning apartment which is due to the fire becoming under-ventilated. In
FDS, however, a soot yield is defined in the input file, which is static,
which means the same amount of soot is produced every second during the
fire scenario. Hence, the choice of soot yield is of great importance for
this particular case and a soot yield of 0.1 for this setup are therefore
considered to be more valid.

The increase in radiation angles in the sensitivity study from 100 angles
to 500 angles had minor effects on the end results. This is due to the
location of the fire plume relative to the facade. If the fire plume is
close to the facade, the impact of an increase in radiation angles on the
radiation picture is minimal compared to if the plume would be far away
from the facade. The further away the fire source is from its target, the
less detailed the radiation picture becomes due to the limited amount of
rays that are emitted from each cell. In the latter case an increase in
radiation angles would have been more beneficial. Since the fire plume
was seen to eject close to the facade in Smokeview and since minor
differences were seen in the radiation pattern at the facade after
increasing the radiation angles, it emerged that the fire plume was close
enough to the facade so that the default value of 100 radiation angles
was sufficient for this geometry.

Studying the difference in output for various positions of thermocouples
are important in order to get an understanding for the consequences in
the choice of where measurements are taking place in the simulations. As
seen from the sensitivity study, depending on the position of a
thermocouple, significant variations in output are found. This outcome
has to be considered when modelling facade fires in FDS. Also, the
influence of mesh alignments was examined. The results showed minor
differences in the outputs as long as a uniform mesh resolution was used.
The simulation with coarser grid size within the fire compartment and
finer grid size outside produced different outputs most likely because
the 10 cm grid was not able to resolve all of the turbulence as a 5 cm
grid would and those errors were passed on out to the finer grid outside
the fire room. Because the 2 meshes configuration had a horizontal mesh
intersection at the facade above the fire, it was expected to influence
on the results. However, it is assumed that this critical mesh division
was not close enough to the more turbulent regions around the fire to
affect the calculations. Hence, the result suggests that the
computational domain can be divided into several meshes in FDS
applications of external fire spread without having to affect the result
to a great extent, given that
a uniform cell size is used throughout.
