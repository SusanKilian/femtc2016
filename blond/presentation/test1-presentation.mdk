[TITLE]

# Introduction

[Don't worry, this section is not long...]{ color:red }

* This work is based on the hot smoke testing system, Izar
* It was developed by the swiss company Basler & Hofmann AG 
* A premixed combustion is the source of energy for the test 
* The results presented in this work are part of its development process
  - The entire work was presented as master thesis within the IMFSE program in 2013

## Before we begin, what is Izar?

[I am very happy with your question...]{ color:red }

## Izar is a system with... a gas burner

## It sounds interesting, but what makes Izar something special?

[Well Izar is definitely a cool machine...]{color :red }

* It doesn't generate soot
 - Nobody likes to clean...
* Live control of the HRR 
 - It is possible to follow fire curves like the t^2^-curve
* A validated FDS model is available 
{.fragmented}

[(Oh, a validated FDS for a testing system? It seems interesting, I will keep attending what this guy is saying...) ]{ color:green }
{.fragment}

## How is that you decided to combine FDS with Izar?

[It is not the best idea to do a smoke test an burn the room... I needed to figure out how to avoid it]{color:red }
{.fragment }

[Yes, that is definitely a good reason]{ color:green }
{.fragment }

* We do the test in rooms in use or just before commissioning
* The room limiting factor must be considered (sprinklers, lights, protected ceilings)
{.fragmented}

## Calculate the plume temperatures originated by Izar
* The temperature is one of the main factors to design the smoke tests
* Realistic test = high temperatures
* Necessary temperature data from Izar for different powers and room heights 

## How to calculate temperatures from premixed flames?
 - The combustion efficiency is the most important factor for premixed flames
 - What happens afterward? --> Not enough studied

## A new framework is developed with FDS to calculate the plume temperature

# And how did you create the FDS model for Izar?

* The combustion itself is "not important", we want to model the plume
 - The combustion will not be modeled 
* We model the combustion products which conform the plume, the "smoke"
* Three initial factors
 - {.fragment}Species
 - {.fragment}Temperature
 - {.fragment}Origin surface

## The initial species (1/2)

* The combustion takes place under stoichiometric conditions
* Well known which the combustion products are

## We define the mass ratio fuel/product 

~ Table  
|----------|------------------|--------------------|------------|
| Specie   | Molecular weight | Amount of products | Mass ratio |
|          | (g)              | (g)                |            |

| N~2~     | 28               | 526.40             | 13.16      |

## The initial species (2/2)

* We calculate the necessary mass flow rate for a desired HRR with the fuel heat of combustion 
* Example for 500 kW
 - Propane heat of combustion: 46 kJ/g
 - Mass flow to achieve 500 kW  
   500 kW / 46 kJ/g = 10.85 g/s

~ Table 
|----------|----------------|-----------|--------------------|
| Specie   | Amount of fuel | Mass ratio| Amount of products |
|          | (g/s)          |           | (g/s)              |
|          |                |           |                    |

[Proper initial values for the subsequent system mass balance]{font-size:smaller;}


# The initial temperature

* The initial temperature of the gas is related with the flame temperature
* The combustion takes places under stoichiometric conditions
* The adiabatic combustion temperature characterizes the flame temperature
* For our case: Flame temperature = 1.995 °C (Propane adiabatic temperature)

# Grid mesh and geometry

* The mesh definition is a critical value in a FDS model
* The combustion product must be introduced in kg/m^2^&sdot;s
* The combustion surface defines the initial moment in the system
* Our system has a geometry of 122 cm (length) x 17 cm (width)
* A 6.5 cm cell size was chosen after a sensitivity analysis

## Radiation

* High combustion efficiency --> low radiation loses
* The radiation fraction can be calculated considering the [partial pressures] [down] 
* The radiation loses of the system are around 3 % 

[down]: # { .navigate-down }

## Well you can find the equation in my paper... {#vertical}

## Let's begin with the plume in FDS

* Using the described initial inputs, Izar was modeled in FDS
* A grid was programmed to measure the temperature
 - Temperature sensor every 20 cm in the X and Y axis
 - Repeated each 19.5 cm in the Z-Axis
* This way of simulating the system avoid possible uncertainties related with the combustion

* The amount of combustion products is in kg/m^2^&sdot;s 
* The boundaries are open --> "free plume"

# Conclusions

* The methodology efficient tool to model the system Izar
* The main inputs are:
  - Combustion products
  - Flame temperature
  - Combustion region geometry
* FDS resolves properly the turbulence and entrainment around the plume
  - The centerline plume temperatures confirm this point

# Future work
* Different configurations
  - Different fuels
  - Different geometries
* Validate the model in tunnels
* Development of plume equations
* Test and validate new premixed burning submodel

# The future of the FDS Simulations?

* The model can be used to validate FDS geometries "a priori"
  - We can carry out a test with Izar
  - We take the necessary measures
  - We use the validated FDS model from Izar to calibrate the simulation
  - We program the design fire
  
* This way we reduce the uncertainties related with the geometry
* Reduce the safety factors 
* Optimize the smoke extraction system
  

# Thanks for your attention
