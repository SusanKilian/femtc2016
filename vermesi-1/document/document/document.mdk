[TITLE]

~ Abstract
Medium density fiberboard (MDF) is an engineered wood product that is widely used 
in the interior design of buildings and in furniture because of its good performance, 
ease of use and cost efficiency. However, like all wood products, MDF poses a fire risk.
While the literature contains a lot of studies for wood pyrolysis and burning,
MDF has not been thoroughly investigated yet. In this work, we study the pyrolysis of MDF 
subjected to transient irradiation in the form of parabolic pulses. 
While the majority of studies in literature employ a constant heat flux, we use transient irradiation 
to obtain a more comprehensive case. A one dimensional model was set up in GPyro, a generalized pyrolysis code. 
The model uses heat and mass transfer and temperature dependent properties for each material. 
We use a kinetics scheme that includes drying and 4 competing reactions in which the four components of 
MDF (lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose and resin) decompose into char. For the surface temperature, 
the model predictions experiments show very good agreement with experimental measurements that were performed 
in an FPA (Fire Propagation Apparatus).

# INTRODUCTION { #sec-intro }
You are encouraged to use the [Madoko.net Editor][editor] while using
the [Madoko Reference Manual][reference-manual] to edit/commit your
documents into the 'authoring' branch of the [femtc2016] GitHub repository. 
More information about this method of contribution will be covered below.

Text styling, links, sub- and super-script, footnotes and other topics
are covered in section [Syntax: Inline
elements](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/daan/madoko/doc/reference.html#sec-syntax--inline-elements)
of the manual.

Headings, Figures and Tables, Lists, Code Blocks, Mathematics, etc. are
covered in section [Syntax: Block
elements](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/daan/madoko/doc/reference.html#sec-syntax--block-elements)
of the manual.

The target length for submitted and invited papers is about eight pages.
This length includes all figures and tables. However, because the
Proceedings will not be printed on paper, there is no maximum limit on
the number of pages. You are free to exceed the target length of eight
pages.

Please watch this short YouTube Video for a tutorial on how to use the system as intended.

# EXPERIMENTS
Main Headings are all upper case letters and underlined. In Madoko, a
Single '#' symbol at the start of the line, followed by a space and then
the heading text.


Subheadings within sections follow the same format as section titles, but
with upper and lower case. In Madoko, a Double '#' symbol at the start of
the line, followed by a space and then the heading text.

# PYROLYSIS MODEL
Original drawings and photos may be included in your paper as figures.
Diagrams may be in color.

Figures and tables should immediately follow first mention of them in the
text and can be placed in one column, or in the case of wider figures,
can cover two columns (but only at the top or bottom of the page). The
caption should start with either the word “figure” spelled out or
abbreviated, followed by the figure number (i.e., Figure 1 or Fig. 1).
The figure caption should be followed by a single line of space before
the text resumes.

## Governing equations
Figure [#fig-smokeview] in Section [#sec-intro] shows an image from an
older version of Smokeview. Note that you can drag&drop images into the
editor pane to include them in the document, and similarly with bibtex
files, latex style files, etc.
~ Equation { #euler }
e = \lim_{n\to\infty} \left( 1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n

## Chemical Kinetics

## Model Parameters
Table [#table-sample] shows an example full width table figure.

Equations

Standard terminology should be used in equations. If possible, keep
equations to one column. All equations should be numbered. A definition
of $e$ is shown in Equation [#euler]:

~ Equation { #euler }
e = \lim_{n\to\infty} \left( 1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n

# FUN CONTENT EXAMPLES
Let's program some JavaScript:
``` javascript
function hello() {
  return "hello world!"
}
```
Here is a footnote[^fn] reference.
[^fn]: This is the content of the example footnote. 
    You can continue a footnote by indenting content.
    And notice the back link.

# BIBLIOGRAPHY AND REFERENCES
When references are used in the text, tie them to an alphabetical (by
principal author) list of references to be included as the last item of
your paper. The format commonly used in scientific literature follows:

Smith, J. S., Bloggs, R. T. and Jones, E. R. (1974), "Magnetic Anomalies
in Geothermal Systems", Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 254, 73-79

Leslie Lamport, LaTeX: A Document Preparation System (2nd Edition), Addison-Wesley, 1994

When using Madoko, edit the content of the .bib file in the document
folder, and use the reference methods as shown in the [Bibliography and
Citations
Section](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/daan/madoko/doc/reference.html#sec-bib)
of the Madoko Manual.

A bibliography file consists of all your references in the BibTeX format, for example:

    @BOOK{ Knuth:TeX,  
        author   = "Knuth, Donald E.",  
        title    = "The {\TeX} book",  
        publisher= "Addison-Wesley",  
        year     = 1984  
    }

Entries in the bibliography files can now be referenced using semi-colon
separated references, for example:
``` Markdown 
Read about LaTeX and TeX [@Knuth:TeX; @Lamport:LaTeX].
```
Results in: Read about LaTeX and TeX [@Knuth:TeX; @Lamport:LaTeX].

Please include full title of journal articles or other references,
journal, volume, date, pages. There is a nice [table on
Wikipedia](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Bibliography_Management#BibTeX)
that shows all of the different data fields for the BibTeX file.

# PAPER DEADLINE
Your paper, in final form, must be received by October 15th, 2016. The
best way to edit and submit is to use the Madoko [editor] to edit your
document in the 'authoring' branch of the GitHub [femtc2016] repository.
If you choose to use some other document format and editing tool, PDF
format is preferred, but ODT, DOC, or DOCX formats are acceptable. Please
e-mail the files to [conference@thunderheadeng.com][emaillink].

# PRESENTATION
Each author must present his/her paper within the allotted time, allowing
for some minutes of open discussion. The session chair is responsible for
keeping authors within their time limit, in order to ensure that each
author has enough time for their presentation. When preparing your
presentation slides, make sure they are clear and large enough so that
your audience can read them from as far as 80 feet away.

All presentations will be made using the computer projector available in
the conference room. We will not have overhead projectors or slide
projectors in the meeting rooms.

Your presentation, in final form, must be received by **October 15th,
2016**. A final commit of the files to the GitHub repository is
preferred. Once the final draft is complete and reviewed it will be
merged into the master branch of the repository. If you decide to use
some other tool for creating your presentation, PDF format is preferred,
but ODP, PPT, or PPTX formats are acceptable. Please e-mail the files
to [conference@thunderheadeng.com][emaillink].

All presentations will be pre-loaded on the computers that are present.
Please note that this approach will make it necessary for us to receive
the presentation files prior to the conference. If you have a different
software requirement, it should still be possible for you to attach your
own computer to the projector if you bring it with you. This is not
optimal, as it takes time and slows down the session.

# CONFERENCE CONTENT DISTRIBUTION
The papers and presentation materials will be made available online
during and after the conference. In addition, the organizers are planning
to may broadcast live presentations online during the event. The papers,
presentations, and videos will be archived and made available on the web
after the conference.

Author(s) retain all rights to submitted material. The organizers are
granted a non-exclusive right to copy and redistribute conference
material submitted by the author(s).

# An appendix { @h1:"A" }
"All the same, I should like it all plain and clear," said he
obstinately, putting on his business manner (usually reserved for people
who tried to borrow money off him), and doing his best to appear wise and
prudent and professional and live up to Gandalf's recommendation. "Also I
should like to know about risks, out-of-pocket expenses, time required
and remuneration, and so forth" -- by which he meant: "What am I going to
get out of it? and am I going to come back alive?"

# Conclusion
If you have any questions concerning your paper and/or the Conference,
please email us at [conference@thunderheadeng.com][emaillink].
