~ Abstract
The use of evacuation models has increased in recent years due to architectural 
complexity of projects and in many cases code requirements. With the wide range 
of egress modeling software packages available however, users are often unfamiliar 
with how sensitive these models are to the various input parameters, especially 
when questioned by approving authorities. This paper examines the sensitivity 
of varying walking speeds on stairways using  the results from the software 
package ‘Legion Evac’ to provide engineers with the justification needed when 
asked by the approving authority to lower occupants’ stairway walking speeds as 
a safety precaution.

# INTRODUCTION { #sec-intro }
When conducting a performance based-design, engineers tend use the timed egress model, 
where the Available Safe Escape Time (ASET) is compared to the Required Safe Escape Time 
(RSET) [1, 2]. ASET is the time it takes until untenable conditions are reached in 
the space while RSET is the time it takes occupants to evacuate the space safely prior 
to reaching untenable conditions [2]. To determine the RSET, engineers rely on published 
data covering the time it took people to recognize / react to an emergency situation 
along with walking speeds over horizontal and vertical means of egress components [1, 2].

Engineers have a number of tools that can be used to determine the RSET, such as computer 
evacuation models and the SFPE hydraulic model. While such tools vary in complexity, one 
of the common input parameters in all  the tools is occupant walking speeds. This input 
data can be found in various fire protection engineering guidelines [1, 3] however, it 
is not clear when to use such data. While some computer evacuation models are preloaded 
with preset walking speed data, such data is only applicable for specific occupant profiles 
(e.g. commuter, tourists) that might not be applicable to other occupancies or even other 
cultures, especially that studies have shown that culture can have a significant effect on
 occupant walking speed [4]. This causes some approving authorities to question the results 
 of evacuation models and in a few cases request the use of lower walking speeds to create a margin of safety. 
 
This paper presents the effects of lowering agent evacuation speeds over stairs on occupant 
flow and total evacuation time in a high-rise building.

# OVERVIEW OF MODELING SOFTWARE USED { #sec-intro }

The modeling software used for this study is an agent-based model called “LEGION EVAC”, 
which has the ability to simulate people in either 2D [5] or 3D. The modeled space is 
divided into a two-dimensional / continuous space that allows simulated occupants (entities)
 to move freely and avoid modeled obstacles, walls and other entities [6]. Collision avoidance
  with other entities and obstacles is achieved through the “least effort” algorithm 
  developed by Still [5], where entities determine the path with the least cost towards 
  their target [7] based on distance, speed and comfort [8].
  
  
# STAIR WALKING SPEED { #sec-intro }

Walking speeds over stairs in evacuation models are determined using two main approaches; 
the first uses mathematical correlations derived from field observations, such as that 
illustrated in the SFPE hydraulic model, Fruin’s levels of service or BS 7974:2001 [3, 9, 10] 
where walking speeds are decreased based on the slop of the stair and crowd density. 
The other approach is by allowing the user to input such speeds from scientific 
publications [1, 2], which depends on the user’s familiarity with the published data.   

While some researchers have been highlighting the limited availability for additional 
human behavior data, including stair walking speeds, others have been questioning the 
validity of the current data due to anthropometric changes over the past few decades [11].

# STUDY GOAL { #sec-intro }

There are a number of published studies addressing walking speeds over stairs however, 
the majority of them are validating new and existing models [12, 13]. This study aims at
addressing the sensitivity of the modeling software Legion Evac results to walking stair
 walking speeds in a high-rise building. It is hypnotized that the total evacuation time 
 will increase along and that occupant flow over the stairways will decrease when using 
 lower stair walking speeds.

The user has the option to choose the predefined entity profiles within the software 
(e.g. UK commuter, Asian commuter, UK tourist and Asian tourist), or input their own 
parameters, such as entities size, walking speed and pre-movement time. In both options, 
each entity is assigned its own unique parameters with various statistical distributions based on the available data. 
Currently, the predefined profiles are not described in detailed within Legion Evac 
user manual, which can cause some approving authorities to questions / request such 
numbers to be provided when reviewing the results.

# METHODOLOGY { #sec-intro }
A user defined entity profile will be setup within Legion Evac that will cover 
entity size, walking speed and pre-movement time. All variables will be obtained 
from published literature and only stair walking speed will be adjusted to eliminate 
the effect of other variables. The used stair walking speed will be decreased in increments 
of 0.1 and ranging between 0.7 m/s and 0.4 m/s. This will result in 4 scenarios with two 
runs conducted for each scenario to ensure that the total evacuation times are consistent 
for each scenario. While the number of scenarios / runs do not allow us to determine the 
statistical significance of the walking speeds on the model’s total evacuation time and 
stairway flow, it will provide preliminary results that might enable engineers to make a 
case when asked to user lower walking speeds and provide researchers with some results to 
formulate future areas of research.

# BUILDING DESCRIPTION  { #sec-intro }
The building used for this study is at 10 story high-rise, with the highest occupied level 
at 38m.  The building’s main entrance is located on the south side at ground level with a 
secondary exit located on the north side. All floors, with the exception of level 10 which 
is accessed by one stairway (Stairway B), are accessed via two 1200 mm wide stairways as 
illustrated in Figure 1. Also, all doors which are part of the means of egress have a clear 
width of 900 mm. 
To eliminate the affects from the underground garage level and mainly focus on the effect 
of walking speeds, only the tower section is considered for this study, where each floor has an area of 922 sq.m.

# INPUT PARAMETERS  { #sec-intro }

## Number of Occupants
While each floor can be occupied by 99 occupants using an occupancy load factor of 9.3 sq.m. 
per person as listed in NFPA 101, Table 7.3.1.2, only 72 occupants are placed on each floor, 
except level 10 which has 31 occupants, to allow for some employee collaboration spaces in the 
layout as illustrated in Figure 1. 

## Entity Body Size   

For uniformity, the body size for all occupants is assumed to follow a normal distribution 
as illustrated in Table 1 [14].

## Entity Walking Speed
The horizontal walking speed used in all the runs is 1.2 m/s, which is derived from the SFPE Engineering Guide on Human Behavior in Fire [1].

The base stair descending speed used for this study is also derived from SFPE Engineering Guide on Human Behavior in Fire [1], which is 0.7 m/s. Due to the lack of published data on other descending stair speed with statistical distributions, the chosen speed for each scenario was applied to all entities. While this might not be a realistic approach as it eliminates some behaviours, such as overtaking slow entities, it does prevent such behaviours form distorting the results. The stair walking speeds used for each run are listed in Table 2.

## Measuring Flow 
In Legion Evac, the “Analysis Line” tool is used to measure information at a certain point. To measure the flow, analysis lines were placed on both stairways at levels 4, 8 at the first descending tread and on the last stairway tread on the ground level. This will measure flow throughout the simulation and illustrate any blockages at the top, middle and lower levels of the building. The presented flows are in entities / minute and are averaged over 12 second intervals to minimize simulation time.

# RESULTS  { #sec-intro }

## Scenario 1
The total evacuation time when using a 0.4 m/s descending stairway walking speed is 13:55 minutes (average of two runs with 5 seconds difference).  

The flow rates on the ground floor did not indicate any blockage occurring at that level as  Figure 2 illustrates a consistent flow for both stairways A and B that averaged around 24 entities / minute.


![Scenario 1 Ground]

~ Figure {; caption:"Scenario 1 Ground Floor Stairway A&B Flow Rates"}
~

The flow rates on level 4 seem to have stopped for short periods and lasted for 2:02 minutes of the evacuation time. This would indicate that there was some blockage in the stairway, which can be attributed to entities entering into the stairways at lower levels. 


![Scenario 1 4th]
[Scenario 1 4th]: images/Scenario-1-4th.PNG "Scenario 1 4th" { width:auto; max-width:90% }
~ Figure {; caption:"Scenario 1 Fourth Floor Stairways A&B Flow Rates"}
~

Similar to level 4, the flow rates for stairways A and B on level 8 illustrated in Figure 4 indicate that there was some congestion in the stairways from caused by merging flow from below levels. This prevented occupant movement for approximately 5:20 minutes.


![Scenario 1 8th]
[Scenario 1 8th]: images/Scenario-1-8th.PNG "Scenario 1 8th" { width:auto; max-width:90% }
~ Figure {; caption:"Scenario 1 Eighth Floor Stairways A&B Flow Rates"}
~

## Scenario 2

The total evacuation time when using a 0.5 m/s walking speed when entities are descending a stairway 
was 11:43 minutes (average of two runs with 8 seconds difference).


The flow rates on the ground floor did not indicate any blockage occurring at that level as Figure 5
illustrates a consistent flow for both stairways A and B, with an average flow of 29 entities / minute. 



![Scenario 2 ground]
[Scenario 2 ground]: images/Scenario-2-ground.PNG "Scenario 2 ground" { width:auto; max-width:90% }
~ Figure {; caption:"Scenario 2 Ground Floor Stairway A&B Flow Rate"}
~

Level 4 flow rates shown in Figure 6 illustrate flow stoppage, similar to scenario 1. However, this only lasted for 1:35 minutes.



![Scenario 2 4th]
[Scenario 2 4th]: images/Scenario-2-4th.PNG "Scenario 2 4th" { width:auto; max-width:90% }
~ Figure {; caption:"Scenario 2 Fourth Floor Stairways A&B Flow Rates"}
~



Similar to scenario 1, entities were unable to enter the stairways on level 8 for a longer period than level 4; 
however, this only lasted for 4:32 minutes. There is also an initial spike in the flow rate at time 42 seconds 
as entities move towards the exits, this is shortly followed by a sharp decline in stairway flow due to congestion from the floors below.

[Scenario 2 8th]: images/Scenario-2-8th.PNG "Scenario 2 8th" { width:auto; max-width:90% }
~ Figure {; caption:"Scenario 2 Eighth Floor Stairways A&B Flow Rates"}
~


## Scenario 3
The total evacuation time when using a 0.6 m/s walking speed when entities are descending a stairway 10:08 minutes (average of two runs with 3 seconds difference.  

The flow rates on the ground floor for scenario 3 did not indicate any blockage occurring at that level as Figure 8 illustrates a consistent flow for both stairways A and B that averaged around 33 entities / minute.


![Scenario 3 Ground]
[Scenario 3 Ground]: images/Scenario-3-Ground.PNG "Scenario 3 Ground" { width:auto; max-width:90% }
~ Figure {; caption:"Scenario 3 Ground Floor Stairway A&B Flow Rate"}

Level 4 flow rates shown in Figure 6 illustrate flow stoppage, similar to previous scenarios; however, this only lasted for 1:25 minutes.

![Scenario 3  4th]
[Scenario 3  4th]: images/Scenario-3-4th.PNG "Scenario 3  4th" { width:auto; max-width:90% }
~ Figure {; caption:"Scenario 3 Fourth Floor Stairways A&B Flow Rates"}
~

Similar to level 4, the flow rates for stairways A and B on level 8 illustrated in Figure 10 indicate that there was congestion in the stairways from the below levels that prevented occupant from moving for approximately 3:09 minutes. 

![Scenario 3 8th]
[Scenario 3 8th]: images/Scenario-3-8th.PNG "Scenario 3 8th" { width:auto; max-width:90% }
~ Figure {; caption:"Scenario 3 Fourth Floor Stairways A&B Flow Rates"}
~



## Scenario 4
The total evacuation time when using a 0.7 m/s walking speed when entities are descending a stairway 9:04 minutes (average of two runs with 10 seconds difference).  

As seen in previous scenarios, the flow rates on the ground floor did not indicate any blockage occurring at that level as illustrated in Figure 11 (average flow rate of 37 entity / minute).

![Scenario 4 ground]
[Scenario 4 ground]: images/Scenario-4-ground.PNG "Scenario 4 ground" { width:auto; max-width:90% }


~ Figure {; caption:"Scenario 4 Ground Floor Stairway A&B Flow Rate"}
~
Level 4 flow rates shown in Figure 12 illustrate flow stoppage, similar to previous scenarios. However, this only lasted between 1:01 minutes of the evacuation time.


![Scenario 4 4th]
[Scenario 4 4th]: images/Scenario-4-4th.PNG "Scenario 4 4th" { width:auto; max-width:90% }
~ Figure {; caption:"Scenario 4 Fourth Floor Stairways A&B Flow Rates"}
~

Similar to level 4, the flow rates for stairways A and B on level 8 illustrated in Figure 13 show a stoppage time of 3:01 minutes, which would indicate that there was some congestion in the stairways.


![Scenario 4 8th]

The results indicate that as stair walking speed decrease, so will the total evacuation time generated by Legion Evac in a high-rise building. For example, lowering the stairway walking speed by 42.86 percent can increase the total evacuation time by up to 53.49 percent.  Table 3 compares the decrease in stair walking speeds for each scenario with the increase in total evacuation time.

Decreasing stair walking speed affected stairway flow at the ground level, thus affecting the upper floors in a high-rise building. In extreme cases, the flow decreased  by 35.14 percent when the stair walking speed was decreased by 42.86 percent. A detailed comparison for stair flows at the ground level are shown in Table 4.

When examining the results of the model, it was obvious that there was some congestion in the stairways due to the number of occupants accessing them. This has resulted in flow stoppage on levels 4 and 8, which increased significantly as the stair walking speed was decreased. The observed stoppage times for both levels 4 and 8 are listed in Table 5 and Table 6. In addition, the stoppage time seems to increase on higher levels, which is probably due to the increase in merging flow from the floors below.

# FUTURE WORK  { #sec-intro }
This is part on an ongoing study that aims at conducting a more detailed sensitivity analysis for Legion Evac and other evacuation models and comparing the results to assist engineers and researchers in choosing the most appropriate evacuation tool for the intended application. Future publications will examine other software packages, such as Pathfinder and FDS + Evac. 

# CONCLUSION  { #sec-intro }
 The increase use of evacuation models has brought a number of modeling software packages into the market, which vary in capabilities, input variables and results. Without understanding the effects that the input variables have on the results of a model, engineers  might be forced by the approving authorities to use lower values thinking that this would provide a safer design. The results of this study indicate that varying the walking speeds over stairs for entities in the software package Legion Evac can greatly affect the total evacuation time while increasing occupant stoppage time due to congested stairways. This indicates that a more detailed sensitivity analysis should be conducted to benefit engineers and software developers. It also illustrates the need for additional people movement data that can greatly benefit engineers and researchers.
