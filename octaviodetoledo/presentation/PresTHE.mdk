# Introduction

## General overview

* Fire safety in subway stations: BIG CONCERN.
* Arson attacks in subway trains.
  - Firestarr project: arson stated as the main cause of fire in subway trains.
  - UK data: 2.911 fires in trains (from 1992 to 2000), 77,8% of which 
  involving passenger trains (56% due to arson attacks).
* Platform Screen Doors (PSD): Effect on evacuation and safety?

# Subway stations

## General overview

* Cut & Cover
  - Main feature: big volume, escalators and stairs in platform.
  - Platform: 135m (long) x 9m (wide) x 6,75m (high).
  - Tracks: 7,5m (wide).
* Cavern
  - Less volume than C&C: escalators and stairs not in platform.
  - Platform: 135m (long) x 4,25m (wide) x 6m (high).
  - Tracks: 7,5m (wide).

## 3.1.- Fire curve

* HRR fire curve: Eureka project (subway car).

## 3.4.- Ventilation strategy

* Strategy A: with PSD

  - Station's exhaust: 83,3 m3/s (CyC), 61,1 m3/s (Cavern).

  - Tunnel's exhaust: 87,5 m3/s.

  - Exhausting from the station and  the tunnel is compatible.


* Strategy B: without PSD

  - Tunnel's exhaust: 87,5 m3/s.

  - Exhausting from the station and  the tunnel isn't compatible.


## 3.4.- Ventilation strategy

* Example: platform in M5 subway line in Milan (Italy).

# 4.- Fire and evacuation simulations


## 4.1.- Evacuation conditions

* NFPA 130.

* Visibility: 10m (doors, walls).

* Temperature: threshold time for incapacitation.

* CO concentration: threshold time for incapacitation.

## 4.2- Cut & Cover stations (I)


* Design with Pyrosim.

* Means of egress.

  - An emergency door on each side.

  - Escalator + stairs on each side.



## 4.2- Cut & Cover stations (II)


* Development of the fire.

  - Fire: last carriage on the right.
  - Each carriage is connected to each other.
  - Each carriage has 3 windows per side, which break out when T=470ºC.

## 4.2- Cut & Cover stations (III)


* Development of the fire.

  - Buoyancy: the smoke heads toward the upper part of the station (no PSD).
  - Figure: Temperature levels (t=6min, 80ºC in bold).

## 4.2- Cut & Cover stations (IV)


* Development of the fire.

  - Highest T passengers face: 80ºC in the stairs (no PSD) and close to PSD (with PSD).

  - Visibility: great differences in front of the carriage.

## 4.2- Cut & Cover stations (V)


* Development of the fire.

  - Visibility: great differences all along the platforms.

## 4.2- Cut & Cover stations (VI)


* Evacuation simulation with Pathfinder.

  - Occupation load: 380 p./platform + 60 p./train.

  - Time to react: variable.

  - Smoke makes passengers move slower.

  - Escalator on the right side on the most affected platform: out of service.

  - Similar time needed for evacuation: 140s (with PSD) and 148s (without PSD).

    - Passengers react quickly, low occupation load: they are barely affected by the smoke.

    - Harsh conditions: only without PSD, on the stairs.


## 4.3- Cavern stations (I)

* Means of egress.

  - An emergency door on each side of the platform.

  - Two passageways.


## 4.3- Cavern stations (II)


* Development of the fire.

  - The same conditions as in C&C stations.

## 4.3- Cut & Cover stations (VI)


* Evacuation simulation with Pathfinder.

  - Occupation load: 380 p./platform + 60 p./train.

  - Time to react: variable.

  - Smoke makes passengers move slower.

  - Escalator on the right side on the most affected platform: out of service.

  - Similar time needed for evacuation: 121s (with PSD) and 116s (without PSD).

    - Passengers react quickly, low occupation load: they are barely affected by the smoke.

    - Harsh conditions: only without PSD.


# 5.- Conclusions


- Occupation load: key factor.

- PSD offer better evacuating conditions.

- PSD make compatible exhaust from tunnel + station.

- Time for detection: great relevancy.
