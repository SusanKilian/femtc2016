~ Abstract
Evacuation planning as part of fire safety management, is mandatory in Portugal 
for new and existing buildings. Estimating the egress time is paramount for the 
development of emergency evacuation plans. For this estimation, 
fire drills are undertaken. However, carrying out fire drills demands a certain amount 
of time and financial resources. In addition to that, fire drills might not be realistic 
for the worst case scenarios, such as having one or more exits blocked due to fires, 
or when other types of emergency situations are considered such as earthquakes 
or even terrorist attacks. For these reasons, a robust and validated 
People Movement (PM) model, such as Pathfinder, can be a very useful tool for 
emergency evacuation planning. For instance, with Pathfinder, it is possible to 
evaluate many combinations simulating various situations. In this paper, 
the two major concert hall theaters in Porto, Portugal, are used as case studies: 
Casa da Música and Coliseu Porto. Using Pathfinder it was possible to represent 
different scenarios, estimate egress times in a set of combinations with all
 or part of the exits available. This paper presents some simulations using 
 Pathfinder and compares their results with the times of real egress video 
 camera footage. Therefore, it was possible to assess the simulation tool, 
 evaluating the results and calibrating with the real data in a 
 variety of situations and occupations.

# INTRODUCTION

As part of any adequate fire safety management for existing buildings,
the assessment of the means of escape, which includes the time the
occupants will take to reach a place of relative safety, is paramount.
With this assessment, emergency evacuation plans are developed. For this,
fire drills are undertaken.

However, carrying out fire drills often can demand certain amount of time
in organizing and conducting them, which can have negative impact in both
aspects: on the business continuity and wellbeing. In addition to that,
fire drills might not be realistic for the worst case scenarios, such as
having one or more exits blocked due to fires. Indeed, the challenge
increases when other types of emergency situations are considered, either
natural or non-natural, such as earthquakes or even terrorist attacks.

For these reasons, a robust and validated People Movement (PM) model,
such as Pathfinder, when appropriately used can be a very useful tool for
emergency evacuation planning. For instance, with Pathfinder, it is
possible to evaluate many combinations in a short time, simulating
various situations (i.e, fire risk scenarios).

In this paper, the two major concert hall theaters in Porto, Portugal,
are used as case studies, namely: Casa da Música (by renown Pritzker
winner architect Rem Koolhaas, 2005) and Coliseu Porto (a classic
building from 1940). Both can hold many hundred spectators. For instance,
Casa da Música can accommodate near 1250 persons, while Coliseu Porto
around 3500 people. By using Pathfinder it was possible to represent
different (fire risk) scenarios, for estimating egress times in a set of
combinations with all or part of the exits available. This allowed the
emergency management team to prepare and train the evacuation personnel.

This paper presents some simulations using Pathfinder and compares their
results with the times of real egress video camera footage. Therefore,
with this, it was possible to assess the simulation tool, evaluating the
results and calibrating with the real data in a variety of situations and
occupations.


# USING PATHFINDER AS AN EVACUATION PLANNING TOOL

Pathfinder can be used as an evacuation planning tool for assisting
emergency planners on assessing the egress time(s) in different
scenarios, without the need of conducting real scale evacuation fire
drills. Using the Pathfinder, after having the scenario built up within
the model it was easily possible to change the exits' availability during
the simulations. For instance, to consider a blocked exit in order to see
the impact on the egress.

Another aspect which is relevant to be mentioned is related to the
population density within the built environment. Although typically the
worse scenario is used, that is, with full capacity, it is possible to
try different layouts and space usage, to evaluate/predict the building
occupants' behavior in such conditions. This is of great importance for
all involved in planning, specially regarding auditoriums that can hold a
great number of persons.

Therefore, in order to use Pathfinder as a simulation tool, it is
required to calibrate the model. As such, in this paper, we present two
case studies, where real times were compared with the Pathfinder
estimated egress times.

In both examples presented, the model was put up by using a two
dimensional emergency plan image imported into Pathfinder. After having
the scale calibrated, some core-parameters were established, such as: the
areas where the building occupants were considered to be placed, the
location of the exits and the exit paths. When there are seats, each one
was plotted and put in place.


# CASE STUDY: CASA DA MÚSICA

Casa da Música is a modern concert hall designed by architect Rem
Koolhaas and opened in 2005. There are two Auditoriums, the main one is
named “Sala Suggia”, as an homage to Guillermina Suggia, Porto’s native
world class cellist, having a top capacity of 1244 places. The other
Auditorium, “Sala 2” can receive up to 250 persons seated or 650
standing.

As mentioned previously, the main Auditorium of Casa da Música, "Sala
Suggia", has a full capacity of 1,244 people, but it can vary according
the layout used. For example, without the choir places, located at the
back of the stage, the audience is limited to 1,069 seats. Total area is
around 1,100 square meters.

Table [#table1] shows a comparison between real egress times of the
public leaving the audience towards the outside and those egress times
obtained using Pathfinder. The real egress time was obtained by visioning
the internal video surveillance footage (i.e., Closed-Circuit Television:
CCTV). It should be noticed that many of the spectators left the room
slowly as they were chatting with some colleagues. Furthermore, this
condition, is very likely to have increased substantially the overall
egress time than expected in a real emergency situation. Nevertheless,
the values in the table can be used as benchmark for calibrating the
model.

The Pathfinder model is shown in figure [#figcdm_sala1pf1]. Each seat row
was plotted and put in location, having people assigned up to the maximum
number of seats. The only way out for each seat row is at each end. With
this, it was not possible to have agents (i.e., the representation of the
building occupants) going over seats or surpassing other agents.

Figure [#figCdM_sala1PF2] shows a snapshot of the simulation process,
having only the usual 4 exits, left and right, and the rear emergency
exits closed (red rectangle). This represents the layout used to collect
data shown at table [#table1].


## Casa da Música: Sala 2

Sala 2 is the second largest auditorium of Casa da Música. It was
designed as a multipurpose space and, therefore, it is ideal for any type
of event. The access is made through two glass and aluminum doors,
integrated into the partition panels of the foyer. These ports slide,
assisted by a lower engine, and have a safety opening system from the
inside. The chairs, in purple tone, are an elegant tribute to the
Portuguese designer Daciano da Costa, author of this model in the70’s. It
has capacity for 250 people seated or 650 standing, although in the
former, including the foyer. Total area is around 320 square meters.

Table [#table2] presents two concerts held in April, one with 211 people
seated and the other, a rock concert with 638 spectators standing.
Similarly to the table [#table1], real time was computed by visioning
CCTV footage. It was noticed that many of spectators left slowly, taking
longer than what they would probably take during a real emergency
situation.

Figure [#figcdm_sala2PF2] shows a snapshot of the simulation process,
having only the usual 2 exits, left and right, at the bottom of the
auditorium. The emergency exit located at the left (when looking towards
the stage) is close. This is represented in the model with a red line.
This scenario is compliant with the layout of the concerts shown at
table [#table2].

The Pathfinder tool can be used to estimate the improvement when opening
an emergency exit might have in the total egress time.
Figure [#figcdm_sala2PF3] shows the same situation presented before in
figure [#figcdm_sala2PF2], this time having the emergency exit, near the
stage, open.

# CASE STUDY: COLISEU DO PORTO

The Coliseu do Porto is a theater in Porto, Portugal. A local landmark
which is a leading venue for music and cultural events. The building was
finished in 1941 having the architect Cassiano Branco, among others prior
to him, to complete the whole project.

In the 1990s two important events marked the history of the venue. In
1995, the building was nearly sold to a Brazilian Church (Universal
Church of the Kingdom of God). However, a mass demonstration of the
people of Porto, promoted by several prominent members of the Portuguese
and, especially, the city’s cultural milieu sparked an intervention that
prevented the deal to take place. The venue was handed over to a group of
citizens that, still today, manages the Coliseu as a cultural venue.

In 1996, a fire destroyed part of the venue, including the stage, the
back-stage and part of the auditorium. Rebuilt over a very short period,
it showed some limitations and the venue suffered new interventions in
1997 and 1998. It was officially reopened in November 1998, about two
years after the fire, and has since then regained its role as one of
Porto’s most dynamic cultural spots.

[coliseu]: images/coliseu.jpg "coliseu" { width:auto; max-width:90% }

The main auditorium of Coliseu Porto has a capacity for 3,500 people
standing and 2,955 seated when we count the first and second stalls, the
dress circle, the boxes, the upper circle and the reserved and general
gallery.

Concerts with full capacity will have the seats removed and people
standing at the parterre. In June this year, Jeremy Clementine concert
filled up almost completely the Coliseu. The real egress time was around
8,5 minutes. Since there is no CCTV inside the main auditorium, times
were estimated using a stopwatch.

The Pathfinder model that was developed considered two scenarios: 1,394
people standing at the parterre, the official maximum capacity, and 1,894
people, an additional 500 spectators. This is part of a process to
increase the number of people at the parterre in the standing audience
scenario.

In both, total estimated egress times were under 4 minutes, indeed, the
1,394 people scenario was just below 3 minutes.

~ Figure { #figColiseu_PF1; caption:"Pathfinder 3D rendering of Coliseu Porto egress with 1,394 standing spectators"}
![Coliseu_PF1]

[Coliseu_PF1]: images/Coliseu_PF1.png "Coliseu_PF1" { width:auto; max-width:90% }

Figure [#figColiseu_PF1] presents a snapshot of the simulation process,
showing the Pathfinder 3D view rendering, for the 1,394 standing
spectators scenario.

When comparing those times with the Jeremy Clementine's concert, it must
be noticed that the Pathfinder model only has a fraction of the
spectators, namely those standing at the parterre. Nevertheless, after
the end of the concert, most of spectators left the main auditorium in
less than three minutes. This same situation was observed in several
concerts afterwards. So, the estimated time by Pathfinder is a realistic
one. This shows it can be used for testing some more complex scenarios,
such as having one or more blocked exits and estimating the egress times
in those scenarios.

![COliseu_PF2_graph]

[COliseu_PF2_graph]: images/COliseu_PF2_graph.png "COliseu_PF2_graph" { width:auto; max-width:90% }

Figure [#figColiseu_PF2_graph] shows how spectators are distributed
during the egress timeline. Interestingly, the number of egressing
spectators at the circular corridor around the main auditorium
("Ferradura", horseshoe in Portuguese) is never more than roughly two
hundred at any given time. This in an interesting aspect, showing that
the flow capacity of that corridor is well dimensioned so as to avoid
bottlenecks.

Further improvements to the models are needed, including adding the
second stall, the dress circle, the boxes, and upper circles. And more
data on real egressing times, in order to make more precise comparisons
and calibrate the model.

The preliminary results are encouraging, allowing managers to better
understand the dynamics of people movement, and realize the egress times.
With a proper model put up and more reliable data, it will be possible to
perform more experiments and possibly acquire valuable information to
validate or improve the existing emergency proceedings.


# CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK

As shown in both examples, Pathfinder can be a useful tool to estimate
egress times, even if they are considering ideal (fire risk) scenarios as
safety margins can be used to balance this aspect; and to evaluate other
options, such as opening an extra emergency exit.

The two case studies presented were developed using a test version of
Pathfinder, without having much detail and optimization of all core
parameters. The experiments made were only mere preliminary tests to
evaluate the tool and prove its application as a valuable aid for the
emergency planner and the safety manager. Pathfinder simulations can be
expanded to increase the number of possibilities and scenarios. For
instance, to test a blocked exit, by fire or another event, such as a
terrorist attack or simply a riot and/or conflicts amongst the
spectators.

The aforementioned examples are among the ways to extend the work
presented and stem other research, exploring the Pathfinder possibilities
to its limit.

It is expected that through the case studies shown in this paper, some
additional light can be brought in how evacuation plans can be developed
and assessed as part of the whole fire safety management package, having
the particular context of the Portuguese building facilities management
as an example. It is also expected that further work and research can be
developed exploring the Pathfinder capabilities for this type of real
application.
