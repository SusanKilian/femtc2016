# Context 
The use of egress simulation models in performance-based analysis relies on the confidence in the input data and the output data.

But, data strongly depend on a large number of parameters.

These parameters model human behavior and are scattered.

&rarr; The results are prone to be scattered.

This study proposes a analysis method to deal with it.



## Aim of the study
Realization of a method to analyze the stochastic aspects of an egress simulation model.

* The method is based on statistical estimations of the distribution quantiles of the output parameters.
The key result is Required Safe Egress Time (RSET).

Benefits of the method:

* Provide quantitative informations on the RSET.
* Justify the number of simulations to obtain a relevant output precision level.

# Statistical analysis method principles {#vertical}

The egress phenomena is scattered in itself: evacuating a building can occur in a lot of different ways.

The method tries to deal with the whole range of possibilities.

A stochastic approach is used for that, generating distribution function for each outputs.

The random aspects are processed by the mean of the confidence interval concept.



## Statistical analysis method: calculation

Example: 

* A sample of n realizations of a random variable that follows a normal law distribution.
* A confidence interval Ip for each quantile &alpha;.
* A level of confidence p: here 90%.

~ Math { #eq-alignment; caption:"Alignment example" }
\begin{aligned} 
 Ip  &= \bigg[\tilde{F}^{-1} \bigg( \alpha -c\sqrt{\frac{\alpha(1-\alpha)}{n}} \bigg) ; \tilde{F}^{-1} \bigg( \alpha +c\sqrt{\frac{\alpha(1-\alpha)}{n}} \bigg) \bigg]
\end{aligned}
~

c equals to 1.645 for p=90%. 




## Calculating the empirical distribution function
&rarr; Random realizations ranked in ascending order constitute the 
empirical distribution function.

## Observations

~ Align-Left
* A random variable can not show a theoretical maximum.
* Even if there is a maximum value, the finite size of 
the samples prevent from calculating this maximum value.

&rarr; Only percentiles are available.

* Available percentiles increases with the growth of the sample size.
* Confidence interval width decreases with the growth of the sample size.

&rarr; So, the required number of simulations is set by:

* the desired precision,
* the order of the desired quantile.

# Hypothesis of the model

The numerical tool used in this study is BuildingExodus.

But, statistical processing can be performed with any simulator.

~ Column { width:60% ; vertical-align:top}
Reminder:

* BuildingExodus is based on a discretization of space in node of 50 cm x 50 cm.
* The connection model is the one of Moore.

## Behavioral hypothesis

~ Align-Left
Occupants:

* have same leaderships,
* have same patience,
* are valid,
* have a speed of 1.2 m/s,
* have a response time (RT) of 15 s or variable between 0 and 30 s,
* act independently of each other.

The identical leaderships imply a conflict resolution time included between 0.8 s and 1.5 s.
 The fixed value of 1.15 s will be use too.

The draws are realized with an uniform law.

## Analysis

It is impossible to statistically determine a RSET maximum.
~ Align-Left
* Extreme percentiles have a confidence interval with infinite bounds.


In any case, a RSET max is bound to a catastrophic scenario.

&rarr; It seems preferable to retain a high order percentile.

* This study used the 95^th^ percentile.
~
~ Align-Left
* The value of this parameter is essential to an egress study conclusions and has to be discussed.
~

## Analysis (2)
The confidence interval decreases with the increase of the number of simulations. &bcheckmark;

There are at least 3 separate evacuation patterns according to the number of occupants.
~ Align-left

* Three parameters sets are based on this three patterns and used in this study to get rid of the occupant density influence.These patterns are used in this study to see the influence of others parameters more independently of the density of people.
~
&rarr; The method provides additional elements to understand evacuation behaviors even in this simplistic case.
